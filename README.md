# Homework Assignment #3
## The Assignment (Scenario):
It is time to build a simple frontend for the Pizza-Delivery API you created in Homework Assignment #2. Please create a web app that allows customers to:
1. Signup on the site

2. View all the items available to order

3. Fill up a shopping cart

4. Place an order (with fake credit card credentials), and receive an email receipt

This is an open-ended assignment. You can take any direction you'd like to go with it, as long as your project includes the requirements. It can include anything else you wish as well.
